Through research and analysis of all the models of various gan, I personally prefer the results of pix2pix and cyclegan. By comparison, I started to experiment with working with pix2pix. I created my own A B dataset and tried to add them to the pix2pix model for training. During the training process, I found that a greater number of steps would increase the accuracy of the results. If I had more time to train the results would probably be better. In subsequent machine learning, I will think about how to better apply to pix2pix in combination with artworks.
